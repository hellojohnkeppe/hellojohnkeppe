This is a fantastic addition to your README because it proves you aren't just "learning" automation—you are actively using it to solve real-world needs. In the world of Administrative Operations, showing that you can "vibe code" a solution to deliver data exactly when and where it's needed is a huge selling point.

Since this is a daily screenshot, you can frame it as your "Automated Morning Briefing."

## 🌦️ Automated Morning Briefing (Zapier + Gmail)

I built a custom automation to streamline my morning routine and ensure I’m always prepared for the day ahead in Beckley, WV. Using a "vibe coding" approach with Zapier, I've created a hands-off workflow that delivers critical data directly to my inbox.


- **The Workflow:** Every morning at 7:00 AM, a Zap triggers to fetch the latest local weather data.


- **The Output:** The system captures a snapshot of the report and emails it to my job-search Gmail.


- **The Purpose:** This project demonstrates my ability to integrate third-party APIs (Weather) with communication tools (Gmail) to enhance personal and professional efficiency.
